Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Renato but you can call me 4xiom4, I like to create programs using different paradigms and languages, I like to think about solutions and solve problems âœ¨.

At night I transform and fix things, from a USB input to printing and creating my own projects on ESP32.

I currently work and develop small-scale Solutions and Developments for the community where I live, improving its environment and quality of life.

You can find me on my social networks as 4xiom4.
